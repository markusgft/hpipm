HPIPM ChangeLog



====================================================================
Version 0.1.2-master
01-Oct-2019

dense_qcqp:
	* add qcqp ipm solver built on top of qp ipm solver

====================================================================
Version 0.1.1
01-Oct-2019

common:
	* change license to BSD-2

dense_qp:
	* general renaming of routines, e.g. d_create_dense_qp_dim => d_dense_qp_dim_create
	* add functionality to compute predicted solution for a new RHS and sensitivity of solution

ocp_qp:
	* general renaming of routines, e.g. d_create_ocp_qp_dim => d_ocp_qp_dim_create
